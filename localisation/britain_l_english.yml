 ###Events 
 UK_World_Building.1.t:0 "Britain's Starting Situation"
 UK_World_Building.1.d:0 "These last few decades have been a dark age for Great Britain.\n\nWith the recent military coup in 1918, Great Britain has existed in constant instability, as her defeat in the last war and subsequent economic breakdown have driven the Empire to near collapse. The Military Government has next to no real popularity, only able to continue existing through an ongoing campaign of brutal political repression, which has greatly strained the Isles' diminishing resources. Only King George V prevents the fall of the fragile Liberal-Monarchist government, but due to recent illness, his ever-apparent mortality will one day destroy the already untenable status-quo. It's only a matter of time for His Majesty to leave this world, and for Britain to be left to its own devices."
 UK_World_Building.1.a:0 "God Save the King!"

 UK_Civil_War_Buildup.1.t:0 "Death of the King"
 UK_Civil_War_Buildup.1.d:0 "Perhaps the only thing that was holding the British State together was King George V. The unifier of Monarchists, Nationalists, and Republicans alike stabilized the country after the past war and following military coup. Last night, His Majesty peacefully in his sleep while surrounded by his family. As the civilians mourn his death, the government mourns for its impending collapse. The heir apparent to the British throne, Edward VIII, has declared that he will lead the British to a new era of monarchy and nationalism, while both Winston Churchill and Oswald Mosley have formed an "Anti-Nationalist Coalition" to oppose him. The British Empire, the great realm which once encompassed whole continents, is at its knees. At its knees not because of an enemy, but because of itself."
 UK_Civil_War_Buildup.1.a:0 "No one can save Britain now."
